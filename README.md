# 💼 CDAC Academic Portfolio ![CDAC PG-DAC](https://img.shields.io/badge/CDAC--Nagpur-Postgraduate--Diploma-blue)

A focused collection of full-stack and frontend projects developed during my **Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC)** at **CDAC – SoftPolynomials, Nagpur** in 2023.  

This compilation reflects my transition from academic learning to building industry-aligned, full-stack applications using modern tools and clean architectural practices.

> ✨ From core programming to full-stack development — CDAC helped bridge theory with hands-on, industry-relevant project experience.
